# pagediff
watch specific URLs for changes 

This is a little one-off project to try to keep track of what changed on a page over time (for me, USCIS address changes)

It uses GitHub actions to run nightly and compares the pages in pages.txt against the last known version, ignoring some very specific things to the USCIS pages.
